WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP pynqz2_i/nv_nvdla_wrapper_0/inst/nv_core/u_partition_p/u_NV_NVDLA_sdp/u_core/u_c/c_int_0/mul_dout0__0 multiplier stage pynqz2_i/nv_nvdla_wrapper_0/inst/nv_core/u_partition_p/u_NV_NVDLA_sdp/u_core/u_c/c_int_0/mul_dout0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

\chapter{Results}
\textit{In this chapter, area results on the FPGA of different designs are presented. Following that, on different hardware designs Neural Network TensorFlow Lite models are executed and perfomances measured. }


\section{Utilization Factor}
	\todo[inline]{utilization factor for different size of mxu core}
	report power and timing 
\todo[inline]{we can still compare the utilization of dtpu with the nvdla}	
	\section{Evaluation metrics}
\todo[inline]{evaluation metrics suggested from the paper}

\section{Neural Networks Models}
\todo[inline] {same NN for different precision and different rows columsn?}
\todo[inline]{Common NN models from MIT tutorial: LeNet (1998) ,AlexNet (2012) ,OverFeat (2013), VGGNet (2014), GoogleNet (2014), ResNet (2015)}

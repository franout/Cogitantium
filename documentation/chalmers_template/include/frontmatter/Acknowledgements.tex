\section*{Acknowledgements}
 It is always hard to write this part of a work. I would say it is the hardest part, more than the technical one.\\
However, let me try to address it anyway. I am apologizing in advance if i will forget something.\\\\

This work is the sum of five years of experiences, from a technical and non-technical point of view, and it has been developed during a terrible event, a pandemic, which has literally stopped the entire world and caused death, issues and debates. However, as the human race has always been, we are resilient to everything, and we tried as much as we could to not let the world stop, especially thanks to technology, Internet and all the related services.
We are just human, but we can do whatever we can image, especially in Computer Science.\\\\

First, I would like to thank my family for all their support and presence, even when i was going counter current in my life.
I would like to thank to both my supervisors Prof. Paolo Bernardi and Prof. Pedro Petersen Moura Trancoso for believing in me without any guarantees on the final work, and their support through this journey.\\

\textit{
To the day in which I learned how to read, an important pillar of my life.\\
To the people who have contributed, in badness and goodness, to make me the person who i am today.\\
To my past and future failures, where I have built and I will build myself.\\
To my feelings, which remember us how much we are fragile but at the same time they remind us that we are human being, and we gather our strength from them.\\
Sapere aude.\\}

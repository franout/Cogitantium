INFO: [Synth 8-7053] The timing for the instance u_NV_NVDLA_cdmai_2/dla/u_partition_c/u_NV_NVDLA_cdma/u_img/u_sg/u_NV_NVDLA_CDMA_IMG_fifo/ram/M_reg (implemented as a Block RAM) might be sub-optimal as no optional output register could be merged into the ram block. Providing additional output register may help in improving timing.
